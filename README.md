### [Election 2016 Analysis](https://github.com/alexguanga/ds-portfolio/blob/master/Election2016Analysis/)
The project is divided into three parts. First, I will look at the trend of the 2016 presidential election. Secondly, I create a script (nytimes.py) which uses an API to find articles on a specific topic for a specific day. Lastly, I analyze information on the donation in the 2016 election.

### [Stock Analysis](https://github.com/alexguanga/ds-portfolio/tree/master/StockAnalysis)
Uses top tech stocks (tutorial found on Udemy: Data Analysis), I analyzed with visuals on their trends. Then I performed a Monte Carlo Simulation to depict potential gains and losses.
