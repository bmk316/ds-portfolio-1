# Data Science Portfolio
***

This repository will contain projects that I have worked to build my expertise in data science. A lot of the projects have been topics I have enjoyed. Other projects have been inspired by tutorials.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*


# Projects
***
### [Election 2016 Analysis](https://github.com/alexguanga/ds-portfolio/blob/master/Election2016Analysis/)
The project is divided into three parts. First, I will look at the trend of the 2016 presidential election. Secondly, I create a script (nytimes.py) which uses an API to find articles on a specific topic for a specific day. Lastly, I analyze information on the donation in the 2016 election.

### [Stock Analysis](https://github.com/alexguanga/ds-portfolio/tree/master/StockAnalysis)
Uses top tech stocks (tutorial found on Udemy: Data Analysis), I analyzed with visuals on their trends. Then I performed a Monte Carlo Simulation to depict potential gains and losses.

### [Iris Analysis](https://github.com/alexguanga/ds-portfolio/tree/master/IrisAnalysis)
The premise behind this project is to predict the type of iris ('setosa' 'versicolor' 'virginica) based on the features. Evaluating the effect of the K in the model.

### [Boston Analysis](https://github.com/alexguanga/ds-portfolio/tree/master/BostonAnalysis)
The project is used to analyze the prices of Boston's homes. The model uses will be used is a linear regression and decision tree regressors. Provides an insight on how decision tree are used for continuous output and not just a classification problem.

### [Titanic Analysis](https://github.com/alexguanga/ds-portfolio/tree/master/TitanicaAnalysis)
The project is predicts the people that will survive in the titanic. A lot of the information is relied on feature engineering. Creating variables with the title of a person is an example. I used random forest to check the performance of the model. Also, used decision trees to find the variables that should be used.
